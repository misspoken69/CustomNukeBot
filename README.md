# Misspoken's Nuke Bot

- Remember to fork the project.
- If you are doing in glitch.com, private the project.
- Don't show ANYONE your project because it contains your bot token.

Thanks for using my raid-bot code ,, =)


# Extra Instructions

- Put your bot's token in server.js, where it says "PUT TOKEN HERE."
- Then put the server's ID into where it says "PUT SERVER ID HERE."
- If you want to change the trigger/prefix, go a little above and change it.

# Do !nuke in the server you want to nuke.
(If it doesn't work, contact me at Misspoken#1122)
